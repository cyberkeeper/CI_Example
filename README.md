# CI Example

Continuous Integration (CI) in software development is a practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. 

Key requirements for CI,
- Use of version control, here it is Git
- Build automation. A GitHub Action will automatically build the code.
- Automated testing. The GitHub Action will run tests. The tests are in JUnit5 format.
